## OOD ~ Object Oriented Dinner

The scope of this repository is: Make your pull request, with the Objects,
you bring, for dinner.

And if I approve the Pull Request you are invited to dinner at my place.

Since I like to talk about OOP, has you can imaging, but I'm a JavaScript programmer.
The language of the menu is JS, with some accent of Backbone.js;
 ~ yes I know we are rude to speak a dialect, instead of a language.

So the next dinner is: <b>18/04/2015<b> at <b>19:30</b>

Make sure you bring good Objects.


Objects:

Dinners -> People [
