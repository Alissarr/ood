![Object Oriented Dinner](http://www.craveonline.com/images/stories/2011/2012/March/Comedy/10-nerdy-last-suppers/last-supper-science.jpg)

The scope of this repository is: ***Make a Dinner***;
You are around Holland, and maybe you are also *a Friend* or *Colleague* (*This is a requirement for this alpha*). Whatever.
You are a cool guy I know! 8-)

To join is really easy: You have to fork this repository, and then create a PR with you, and the *Objects* that you've *bring*.
Remember to add all the Objs to the dinner.

If I approve your PR. You are invited to dinner at my place, with some other programmers, which would like to talk about the same topic.

The criteria's, can be totally subjective, in the sense you can do a super PR, with super clean Objs, but then with a second class wine, I'm sorry that is [unacceptable](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=07So_lJQyqw). :-P

Anyway I will try to be constructive with comments, from a technical point of view.

Then, My house is not that big, so I don't know how many people would apply but anyway I can't host more then 10, for this first try.

Since I like to talk about OOP, and since I've some JavaScript Loves.

The language of the menu is JS, with some accent of Backbone.js;
 ~ *yes I know we are rude to speak a dialect, instead of a language*. - *Slang Pouwa!!!*

So the next dinner is: <b>18/04/2015<b> at <b>19:30</b>
