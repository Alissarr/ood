## OOD ~ Object Oriented Dinner
![Object Oriented Dinner](http://www.craveonline.com/images/stories/2011/2012/March/Comedy/10-nerdy-last-suppers/last-supper-science.jpg)

The scope of this repository is: Make your pull request, with the Objects,
you bring, for dinner.

And if I approve the Pull Request you are invited to dinner at my place.

Since I like to talk about OOP, and I'm a JavaScript programmer.
The language of the menu is JS, with some accent of Backbone.js;
 ~ yes I know we are rude to speak a dialect, instead of a language.

So the next dinner is: <b>18/04/2015<b> at <b>19:30</b>

Make sure you bring good Objects.

### What Object->Methods I have?

**Meal**
```
Meal => {
  addOwner() // Define a person has a host
  addGuest() // Add a person has a guest
}
```

**Person**
```
Person => {
  brings() // Add objects to a person would bring to the dinner
}
```

Some other generics Objects for the dinner
- **Ingredient**
- **Manipulation**
- **Recepie**

### FAQ
This FAQ should be useless because code should be self explanatory. But in case you are scared of code I try to give you small suggestions.

#### How I can add my self to a dinner?
Take a look to one of the files bellow to ```src/dinners```, and then take a look to ```src/attenders```.

#### How I can add an Object that I bring?
Take a look to one of the files bellow to ```src/recepies```.
